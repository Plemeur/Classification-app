## About this repository

This is a base code for classification project using pytorch, I choose to not use any other package on top ofr Pytorch, because I like to be aware of most of the things happening in my code.
That being said, you could be using Pytorch Lightning or Fastai or other higher level API to get to the same result more easily.
